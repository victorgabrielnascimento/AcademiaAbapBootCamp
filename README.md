### Hello Dev

<br>

## Welcome to my final ABAP Academy project, a challenge carried out by the reference company in the market, NTT DATA!

<br>
<p>This project had the goal of showing my knowledge in the language during the academy that lasted from 10-31-2022 to 12-14-2022, as a final challenge I had the objective of creating a responsive register system that, through a screen, could run other 3 systems, one that registers a user with information such as name, surname, RG and registration date, the second screen was the search screen, where it was possible to find a specific individual by a key, which in this case was his RG or the day that it was registered and finally a screen that appeared the records and that could delete the registration of a client.</p>
